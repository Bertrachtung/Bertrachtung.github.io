        <p>Conversion happens everywhere and its goals can include everything from making a purchase to requesting free information. In the era of e-economy, literally, most of the conversion happens on screens and the only way for potential consumers to execute this action is on the pages. As a result, thousands of tips about <em>“How to Increase the Conversion Rate”</em> pop out every time you google about it, most of which talking about <em>“Understanding Your Users”</em> or <em>“Headlines are key”</em>. I <strong>do</strong> admit that the appropriate use of these tips can increase the conversion and in fact, most of them works amazingly well. However, I believe such tips are too functional, in other words, they are more like <strong>Icing on the cake</strong>  and consider the process of conversion from the view of a <strong>designer</strong> instead of a <strong>potential consumer</strong>. So here, we need a systematic analysis about the conversion and the conversion page, then we can understand what the most key elements are in a conversion page. Tips are effective only when your page has been completed with all the basic elements. But how can we define the key elements in a conversion page and a page that is complete?</p>

<h1 id="Inspired-from-the-Model-of-AIAD"><a href="#Inspired-from-the-Model-of-AIAD" class="headerlink" title="Inspired from the Model of AIAD"></a>Inspired from the Model of AIAD</h1><p>Here is the question and we need a solution. Though before we start to brainstorm about the answer, I wanna to tell you about a story of Wechat. </p>
<p>It’s said that before Wechat was invented, the main product manager of this app, Allen Zhang, had been mediating for years about what makes a product really popular but found nothing. One day when he was visiting a Buddhist temple to find the peace for his mind, a monk asked him why he looked so tired. Allen told something about the product, and surprisingly, the monk claimed that he had been a geek before became a monk and he believed the most popular product is the best in self-control. Allen was shocked but comprehended that idea immediately. Holding this principle, he designed Wechat and now it has 100 million MAU over the world. </p>
<p>I don’t mean to suggest that a good product designer should go to temples or churches for inspiration. This story is too legendary and doubtable. However, when we are thinking and building our own theory in product and design, asking, searching and analyzing can be more effective than brainstorming. Theories in marketing, business, psychology and design have covered most areas in a product and easy to use. As a product designer, we can easily apply these theories to our own system and adjust them to meet our need. </p>
<p>So is the conversion. The strategies about conversion has been developing since the first advertisement showed up when ancient people exchanged their goods. Among all the studies of conversion marketing, the model of <strong>AIAD</strong> has captured most of the attention. It stands for the four steps from a potential consumer noticing the product to making a purchase decision: Attention or Awareness, Interest, Desire and Action:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDA_(marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a>) </p>
<ul>
<li>Attention: The consumer becomes aware of a category, product or brand (usually through advertising)</li>
<li>Interest: The consumer becomes interested by learning about brand benefits &amp; how the brand fits with lifestyle</li>
<li>Desire: The consumer develops a favorable disposition towards the brand</li>
<li>Action: The consumer forms a purchase intention, shops around, engages in trial or makes a purchase</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<img src="/2019/05/24/Four_Information_in_Conversion_Page/The_Purchase_Funnel.jpg" title="the Standard Purchase Funnel">
<p>AIAD model is a typical hierarchical model, which built on an assumption that consumers move through a series of cognitive (thinking) and affective (feeling) stages culminating in a behavioral stage (doing e.g. purchase or trial) stage.[1] This model has been accepted widely though with a few criticisms. But what matters is that it was deduced from the view point of consumers rather than the advertisers. That is, to lead a consumer make the final decision, what an efficient marketing strategy should do is to offer persuasive information(stimulus) to trigger them to jump to the next step automatically. Understanding this mechanism under a purchase decision, we can naturally think of the functions of our conversion page. </p>
<h1 id="Knowledge-Trust-Value-Conversion"><a href="#Knowledge-Trust-Value-Conversion" class="headerlink" title="Knowledge-Trust-Value-Conversion"></a>Knowledge-Trust-Value-Conversion</h1><p>Accordingly, we can conclude that a conversion needs some information to drive consumers finally paying for the product and they need to cover the functions in AIAD. Specifically, in a conversion page, the attention of the visitor has been drawn, which means more importance need to attach to the following steps: Interest, Desire and Action. </p>
<p>So is the three steps all what we need? Definitely not. Though the conception is very similar to our solution, it’s not a good model for design: interest and desire are defined by the user instead of us. Our duty is to offer information instead of to control their mind, so we can guess but never decide what they would feel interesting or in desire. The conterpart of the two steps in a page is the information of <strong>Knowledge</strong> and  <strong>Value</strong>. After learning the basic knowledge and judging the value of our product, our custommer will determine whether the product is in their interest and in desire. At the same time, our visitors are smart: they are not easy to pursuade. Born in the time of advertisement, most of them have been immuned naturally from description of all kinds of endorsement. We need something to tell them: hay, though you are far from our product, our description is totally true! Or they just distain your product, closing the page and going to complain about the fake advertisment. This requires us to offer something that dismisses the doubt and lay the trust between vistors and us. This goal can be concluded as <strong>Trust</strong>. </p>
<p>Now we have gotten all the types of information we need to offer in our conversion page: <strong>Knowledge, Trust, Value, Conversion</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Knowledge: The basic information of product, at least contains the name, the type and the size. </li>
<li>Trust: The information that can win visitors’ trust. There are multiple ways to do so. The most typical one is to display other consumers’ reviews. Other ways can be to offer the legal certification of the company or product, to show the insurance information or to find a celebrity endorsement. This kind of information can also, on the other hand, promote the value of product. </li>
<li>Value: How the product differs from others? Why the consumer should choose this one? The content in Value part need to issue these questions. It can be the advantages of a product in price, quality, service or even delivery speed. In small business’s conversion page, this part should be completed with the effort of both market and design departments. In a big e-economy platform，like Amazon or Taobao, such content are mostly offerd by the product owner. </li>
<li>Conversion: After the visitors have understood the product’s value, judged that this is what they need, they will search for the place to order. The page should provide a conspicuous conversion portal. </li>
</ul>
<p>The order of them are not stable and can be adjusted for practice. However, this system seems to be too abstract and we’d better learn it by some examples. </p>
<p>Below is a page of a lotion product on Amazon. </p>
